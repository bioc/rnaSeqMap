Description: Provides means of analysis for RNAseq data, used together with genomic annotation from Ensembl. Requires an xmapcore database in MySQL as a back-end, which is also a storage for sequencing reads. Front-end analyses include transformations of the coverage function, splicing analysis, finding irreducible regions with the two-sliding-windows algorithm and genomic region visualizations.
